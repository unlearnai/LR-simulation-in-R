**This folder contains experiments and proof-of-concept for the PROCOVA-LR**

cor_est_bins.R: R code to explore whether the correlation between true and available underlying probabilities can be estimated by grouping participants into bins (it can't)

factor_power_larger.png and factor_power_smaller.png: Figures to show power curves as a function of the efficiency factor, as requested by the clinical applications team

logistic_demo.R: Proof-of-concept for the usage of the efficiency factor in sample size reduction and power gain

logistic_demo_cntonly.R: Proof-of-concept for the usage of the efficiency factor in control arm only reduction (it doesn't work)

logistic_demo_unbalanced.R: Proof-of-concept for the usage of the efficiency factor in sample size reduction and power gain when the original design doesn't have 1:1 randomization

par_bootstrap.R: Comparing parametric to nonparametric bootstrapping in estimating treatment effect
