# LR-simulation-in-R
Simulation code for PROCOVA-LR (logistic regression) publication and regulatory submission


For hypothesis testing (Sections 4.1 and 4.2 in the LR article)

logistic_base -> scenarios 1a, 1b, 1c

logistic_largvar -> scenarios 2a, 2b

logistic_prevalence -> scenarios 3a, 3b

logistic_randerr -> scenarios 4a, 4b

logistic_shifted -> scenarios 5a, 5b

logistic_omitted -> scenarios 6a, 6b

logistic_secndcov -> a scenario with a second covariate, not discussed in the LR article

For treatment effect estimation (Section 4.3 in the LR article)

logistic_trt_base -> scenario 1b

logistic_trt_largeff -> scenario 1c

logistic_trt_randerr -> scenario 4b

logistic_trt_omitted -> scenario 6b
